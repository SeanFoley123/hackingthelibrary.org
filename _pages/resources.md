This page lists resources that are available to for development of projects from the
[Course Book](/files/HtL_web-book-1.pdf).  Some of these are suitable for use in a final
project; some are suitable for prototyping with during exploration, and can be replaced
by supported hardware for projects that are selected for further development.


## Digital Signage

Duncan is developing software to integrate class projects with digital signage.
If your application lives at a public URL, we will be able to display it on the
digital signs in the lobby. Depending on the project, we may extend this basic API
to allow for controlling applications.


## Sonos (music and audio)

[SoCo (Sonos Controller)](http://python-soco.com) is a simple Python class that allows you to programmatically control Sonos speakers.

[This blog post](http://www.nooganeer.com/his/projects/homeautomation/make-sonos-speak/) describes
a fork that allows you to play an uploaded MP3 file, such as one generated by Google Text to Speech
or an audio synthesis program.

The library has Sonos speakers.


## Slack

It's easy to write a Slack bot. A couple of Python libraries are [here](https://github.com/os/slacker)
and [here](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient).  [Here's](https://realpython.com/blog/python/getting-started-with-the-slack-api-using-python-and-flask/)
a tutorial on using Slack with Flask.

During exploration, we have a sandbox Slack domain https://olin-library.slack.com that we can make
everyone an adminstrator of. Once a project is developed, we can connect a production version to the
Olin Slack team.


## SMS

There's also good support for writing an chat bot that uses SMS.
Twilio is a service that provides programmatic SMS and voice capabilities;
the official Python library is [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python);
a quick start tutorial is [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/sms).


## Voice over phone

Twilio also provides programmatic support for speech, using the same library.
A tutorial is [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/twiml).


## Door Counters

As a means for exploring door counter or other CV functionality, we can set up a loaner laptop or laptops with a webcab in a fixed location in the library.
