* Choose a *different* topic, and find a *different* team mate(s), from the first mini-project.

## Part 1

<i>Due {{ page.parts[1].due_date | date: '%a %b %-d' }}</i>

<i>Your total out-of-class time for the reading, lab, and mini-project is not required to exceed eight hours.</i>

* Demonstrable code in a GitHub repository.
* A five-minute project review presentation.

You may start from other otherwise incorporate code from MP1, so long as you are working on a different topic and
you attribute any contributions.


## Part 2

<i>Due {{ page.parts[2].due_date | date: '%a %b %-d' }}</i>

<i>Your total out-of-class time for the reading, lab, and mini-project is not required to exceed eight hours.
You may stop working on Part 2, regardless of state of completion, after eight hours of out-of-class effort, minus however long the lab work and readings took.
If your work is incomplete because you ran out of time, please make this known to me.</i>

What to deliver:

The repository README should answer the questions below, or link to documents that do.

* What is the vision?
* What does the software do? (Including screenshots.)
* How does the code work?
  * How it is organized
  * What is the data flow
  * How to run the code. Installation and usage instructions work on instructor machines. [You may assume Linux and Python 3.]
* Issues and enhancements
  * Known issues
  * Ideas for what to do next
  * Issues and enhancement may be delivered as a text file in your repo, or they can be [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

The big idea is that someone should be able to understand what your project does, and pick up where you left off. (“Someone” could be a future version of yourself.)
